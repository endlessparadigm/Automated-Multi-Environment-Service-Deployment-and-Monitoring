Automated Multi-Environment Service Deployment and Monitoring Overview: 

You are tasked with automating the deployment of at least two microservices or web applications across three distinct environments: dev, stg, and prod. 
Your goal is to implement a robust CI/CD pipeline that deploys each service or application sequentially through these environments (dev → stg → prod). 
Additionally, you will need to create a system to monitor which version of each service or application is running in each environment, utilizing Kuma Uptime as the monitoring solution. 
This entire solution should run locally on your machine. 
Recommended Tools: While you have the freedom to choose any CI/CD tools and IaC tools for this challenge, we recommend the following due to their suitability for a local-only environment: CI/CD Tools: Jenkins GitLab CI (Self-Hosted) CircleCI Local CLI Docker Compose + Custom Scripts GitHub Actions (Local Runner) Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Tools: Pulumi Terraform Ansible Your Task: Service/Application Deployment Automation: Automate the deployment of at least two microservices or web applications (you may use simple, sample applications, such as basic Python or Node.js applications). Deploy these services or applications sequentially through the environments: dev → stg → prod. Use a CI/CD tool of your choice to manage the pipeline locally. Use an IaC tool like Pulumi, Terraform, or Ansible to set up and manage your environments locally. The deployments should run locally on your machine, preferably using Minikube for Kubernetes orchestration. Containerize the services or applications using Docker, and you may use Kubernetes or Docker Compose for orchestration. Monitoring with Kuma Uptime: Set up Kuma Uptime to monitor the availability and uptime of each service or application across all environments (dev, stg, prod). Ensure that the monitoring solution provides an overview of which version of each service or application is currently running in each environment. The monitoring dashboard should be accessible and clearly display the status and uptime of each service or application. Time Limit: You have one week to complete the challenge. Deadline: The code repository must be shared with us by 6 PM on the last day of the challenge to meet the deadline. After you submit your solution, we will review the code and respond to you as soon as possible with an invitation to the presentation call. During the online call, you will have 60 minutes to present your approach, implementation, and results. Support: If you need any assistance or have questions during the challenge, support will be provided via this Slack channel. Deliverables: Code RepositoryPlease push your code to a Git repository (e.g., GitHub, GitLab). The repository should include all IaC scripts (using tools like Pulumi, Terraform, or Ansible), Dockerfiles, CI/CD pipeline configurations, Kuma Uptime setup, and any other relevant code. Provide a README file with instructions on how to set up and run the solution locally, including steps for running it on Minikube if applicable. Ensure that the repository is shared with us before the deadline at 6 PM on the last day of the challenge. Submitting the link / invitation via Slack or e-mail is sufficient. Live DemoDuring the online call, be prepared to walk through your code, demonstrate the deployment pipeline, and show the Kuma Uptime monitoring dashboard. Evaluation Criteria: Technical Skills: Your proficiency in automation, IaC, CI/CD pipelines, container orchestration, Kuma Uptime setup, and local infrastructure management. Problem-Solving: Your ability to design a solution that meets the requirements within the given time. 

Code Quality: The clarity, structure, and documentation of your code. Presentation: How effectively you explain your solution and respond to questions during the online call.
